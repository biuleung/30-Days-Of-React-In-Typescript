Disclaimer: The project that I am presenting is based on the work of another author(see: https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React). While I have made my own version (by using TypeScript and functional components) of it, I want to acknowledge that the original concept and ideas are not my own. I have attempted to credit the original author and provide a unique perspective on the project, but any mistakes or omissions are my own.
